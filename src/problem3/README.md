# Problem 3: Messy React

## Usage

This project is comprised of 2 files, which are before.tsx and after.tsx. 

The before.tsx contains the original code. I added comments to this file to point out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns in the code.

The after.tsx desmonstrates the refactored code.
